## Description

This app is used to track Steam game prices and to show when a price is below a target discount price. You can create watchlists and add games to them. Then set a target price to see when the games price discounted below that price.

## Background

This app was created as a part of my General Assembly course to demonstrate the Django/Python/SQL stack. Also I frequently purchase games from steam so I created this app to see when games are under a certain price.
